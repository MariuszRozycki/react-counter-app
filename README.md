## Overview
This application is a simple React-based counter that allows users to increment a counter by a specified step, reset it to its initial value, or set it to zero. It features a dynamic, digital clock that can be shown or hidden with a click. The app is styled simply and is designed to demonstrate basic React state management and component interaction.

### Features
* Counter with Adjustable Step: Users can increase the counter by a predefined step. The step value can be adjusted as needed within a range.
* Reset and Zero: The counter can be reset to its initial value or set to zero.
* Dynamic Digital Clock: A digital clock displays the current time and can be toggled on or off.
* Step Adjustment: Users can specify the step value for the counter increment through a simple input field.
